# INTRO TO PROJECT
The code challenge for this week involved developing a project that establishes a many-to-many relationship between two tables named "Product" and "Users", using the "Reviews" table as the joining point. In this relationship, a user can own multiple products and provide reviews for various products, while products can have multiple users and receive reviews from different users.


# PROJECT BUILD UP
To operate my project, you begin by cloning the repository to your local environment through the terminal. This can be done by forking the repository and then using the "git clone [link]" command, where the link is obtained by copying the SSH key after clicking on "code".

After that, open the repository in your text editor and run the "bundle install" command in the terminal. To test the project, run "bundle exec rake console" in the terminal. This will enable you to test the code and its functionalities.
