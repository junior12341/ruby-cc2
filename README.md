#intro
For the code challenge of this week, I created a project that involves a many-to-many relationship between two tables - Products and Users - through the Reviews table. The relationship works in such a way that a user can own many products and provide multiple reviews for various products. Similarly, a product can have many users who have reviewed it.

# running the project
To run the project, you can use the terminal. First, fork the repo and then clone it to your local environment using the command 'git clone [link]'. You can get the link by copying the SSH key after clicking on 'code'. Open the cloned repo in your text editor and run 'bundle install' command in the terminal. To test out the project features, use 'bundle exec rake console' command in the terminal to access the code.
